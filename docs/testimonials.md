> SAFE gives us a fast development cycle for our web and mobile platforms

We at [msu solutions GmbH](https://msu-solutions.de/) are big fans of SAFE stack. For the last couple of years we were already using F# open source technologies for web and mobile projects. Tools like the Fable compiler and elmish are rock solid and a pleasure to work with.

Since the release of SAFE, we see that all these important technologies are now bundled and tested under one big umbrella. 
Especially the commercial support for SAFE is very important for us and our customers.

> It just works!

The docs are very detailed and helpful. I got the template up and running on a public URL on Azure within one hour. Without any issues.
Even though I am new to dotnet core and Azure.

## Demetrix

> SAFE was the perfect place to start our biological design and data management platform

[Demetrix](https://demetrixbio.com/) uses F# for DNA design and data management in our research pipeline.   Our data systems are built on top of SAFE and it was a great experience for both veteran F# developers and people new to the environment.  I would start with SAFE again in a heartbeat for a new project.  We shared [some of our experiences](https://github.com/demetrixbio/presentations/blob/master/OpenFSharp2018/OpenFSharpDemetrix.pdf) at Open F# 2018.
